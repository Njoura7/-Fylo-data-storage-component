## Overview

This was my first project working with SASS, I discovered the power and importance of a preprocessorer and the utilities that it can offer, I highly recommand learning about SASS after having a basic knowledge about CSS.
I also discovered a great tool that help with the sizes of the design:[Pureref](https://www.pureref.com/download.php)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
	/*very useful when you dont need a specific height for the container so you just make it take the height of the */
	height: fit-content;
}
```

```scss
// I learned how to import from another file in sass which miight be usefull to organize the code and maintain the scalability
@import "_media1440.scss";
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I will work more with sass and get familiar with it , I am working on learning more about functions and mixins, maybe I will use them in my next projects
